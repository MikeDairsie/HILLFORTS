Excavations by Mallory (1987; 1989; 1990; 1991; 1995; 1996; 1997; 1998; 1999) reveal that all three enclosing elements comprised an internal revetted bank and an external V-shaped ditch 2.3 _ 3.2m deep. A portion of a large structure was excavated at the centre of the monument and delimited by a concentration of pits containing bronze and gold-work. These were dated to the Late Bronze Age. A possible entrance in the internal enclosing element (15m in width) has been partially excavated. An entrance gap in the middle enclosing element to the NE was excavated. It comprised a 3m wide entrance flanked on either side by a palisade and is aligned towards the King¬ês Stables, a man-made ritual pool 300m to the NE of Haughey's Fort.

A dendro-date of 1166 BC was recovered from water-logged wood at the base of the inner ditch (Ballie and Brown 1991; Ballie and Brown 1998). Artefactual evidence supports the absolute dating of the site. Two radiocarbon dates from an irregular pit returned a date range of 400 _ 200 BC. This pit also contained artefacts that may be typologically dated to the Iron Age. A cup and ring marked stone was found in pit within the interior of the hillfort. Aitchison (1998) has suggested this rock art dates to the Neolithic/Early Bronze Age. The artefact was deposited in a pit radiocarbon dated to the Late Bronze Age (Mallory 1995).

This comprises three concentric arcs of stakes set outside larger post-holes measuring 25 _ 30m in diameter. This structure delimits pit features that contain charred cereal grain, small traces of gold, bronze, glass, stone artefacts and pottery. The gold was 'almost microscopic' in size. They consisted of small fragments of gold leaf or gold wire. Mallory (1995, 80) has suggests that the gold items might represent industrial waste. A large pit in the interior, approximately 2m in diameter and 2.5m deep, contained Late Bronze Age coarse-ware pottery and animal bone (pig, cattle and red deer). The basal deposit of this pit was waterlogged. Worked and perforated wood was recovered from this context (Mallory 2000b, 7).

Intensive occupation of the hilltop in the Early and High Medieval periods saw the refurbishment of the enclosing elements (Proudfoot 1954, 100).           Upon excavation the enclosing elements were shown to comprise a ditch-bank-ditch arrangement, although several phases of construction were noted by Proudfoot (1954, 97_98), potentially ranging from the Late Bronze Age to Medieval periods. Upon excavation, the inner ditch measured 3.3m wide and almost 2.4m deep (Proudfoot 1954, 100). Proudfoot (1955, 66) suggests that the inner ditch is of slightly later date, and that the bank and outer ditch are contemporary. A small counterscarp bank was also noted on the outside of the ditch.          A series of post-holes at the edge of the exterior bank face, suggest a palisade was used to contain an earthen bank (Proudfoot 1954, 98 _ 99). No charcoal was present inferring the palisade had decayed in-situ. Further excavations revealed that a similar setting of post-holes abutting the inner face of the bank was linked to the outer example by a series of shallow transverse trenches which have been interpreted as the bedding trenches for tie-beams (Proudfoot 1955a, 59), although this seems to be a later ¬´re-furbishment¬ê of the enclosing elements and not an original feature. Further tie-beams may have been used throughout the height of the bank, but have been destroyed by its erosion (Proudfoot 1955, 59).",2.4,,,,2.4,,No,"Estimated area based on traces visible on satellite imagery and Proudfoot (1954, fig2)",Yes,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,And ditches,No,,Yes,2.0,Internal and external ditch with intervening bank.,No,None.,"Proudfoot, B. 1954.

Coarse ware pottery √áprobably relates to phase I¬ê (Warner 1972), the phase of hillfort construction. This type of pottery, as stated previously, can be firmly dated to the Late Bronze Age.

Warner suggests that these are possibly Late Bronze Age in date (Warner 1974).

Antrim. It is bounded to the E by cliffs culminating in the promontory of Fair Head, some 200m high, and to the W by a headland of basalt some 60m high. The River Margy flows into the bay at its W end. It has superb views all round. The visible remains comprise an almost level triangular area 30m N-S by 45m wide and falls away down the cliff everywhere except the SE, where the neck is enclosed by a rock-cut ditch and there are elements of a masonry castle with a wall and gatehouse built in basalt bonded with coarse mortar. According to McNeill (2004), the remains of at least two structures survive in the interior and there are probable traces of others. Excavation of the site in 2004 revealed a more complex history. A trench was excavated across the expected line of any bank or wall along the inner side of the ditch (McNeill 2004, 173). This revealed a pile of large stones up to half-a-metre across lying on a truncated soil. Along the top of this material was a poorly defined shallow scoop filled with dark brown earth. Over the stones to the N lay a deposit of brown earth 0.2m thick. At the S end of the trench between the stones and the lip of the ditch was a narrow berm on which was found a dump of pink clay. McNeill observes that in section, the stones and other associated material have every appearance of being the remains of a truncated bank, lying within the line of the ditch (2004, 173). Two sherds of prehistoric pottery were recovered from the pile of stones in Trench 2. This possible inner bank material was also found in Trench 1 along with the remnant of a turf pile against it. The excavated ditch was some 6m deep and flat bottomed and contained much dumped medieval refuse. McNeill however notes that the flat bottom and near vertical lower sides looked as though they had been made as a result of quarrying the basalt for stone, presumably for the medieval gate structure (2004, 182). Higher in the ditch the sides were less vertical and McNeill suggests that this sloping upper section may be the remains of an earlier ditch, later deepened, and this may relate to the remains of the truncated bank and inner turf pile. This early phase may have been a late prehistoric or protohistoric promontory fort reoccupied as a base for a small detachment of troops in the late sixteenth century (ibid).

Antrim. It has been largely destroyed by quarrying, but projects N between Boheesshane Bay and Larrybane Bay. The promontory is composed of chalk, overlooking Sheep Island with extensive views of Rathlin Island to the NE and good views up and down the coastline to the NW and SE respectively. An exposed site, the promontory falls away sheer down the cliffs some 40m to the sea on the W and N, while on the SE it is no bounded by the face of the quarry which resumed at the site during the 1950s. Few definite features remain that correspond to Proudfoot's plan drawn in 1960-1, which on the SW shows a curving ditch and an internal stone faced bank cutting off the promontory from the mainland. A section of linear grass-covered stone bank 8m long, 4.5m wide and 0.8m high at SE is possibly a remnant of the original rampart. Outside this are the remains of a possible ditch, while to the W are a further length of a possible ditch at the W margin of the promontory; the latter is c. 10m in length, c. 4m wide and 1m in depth.It was first excavated by Gordon Childe in 1935, who, working in the W part of the interior, was able to distinguish ""over a comparatively small area"" at least four phases of occupation ""on and in, as well as under"" the rampart debris (Proundfoot and Wilson 1960-1, 93). The site was later excavated in the 1960s by Proudfoot and Wilson who cut sections revealing the  stone-faced rampart and external ditch on the landward side. The rampart was composed of large basalt boulders which rested on blue clay. The inner and outer stone facing consisted of flat stones up to 6 courses high in places. A large quantity of small chalk stones were found in layers that sloped up to the face of the bank, which Proudfoot and Wilson suggest must have been originally piled on top of stone rampart (1960-1, 95). The ditch had been cut through the boulder clay and underlying chalk bedrock. In 1838 Fagan recorded the ditch as '23 feet wide, and the top of the rampart stood 8 to 12 ft. above its bottom'. Within the interior of the site, a number of hearths were found but no building outlines, suggesting to Proudfoot and Wilson that houses were composed of turf (ibid., 105).
