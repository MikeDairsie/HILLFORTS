Artefactual evidence supports the absolute dating of the site. Two radiocarbon dates from an irregular pit returned a date range of 400 _ 200 BC. This pit also contained artefacts that may be typologically dated to the Iron Age. A cup and ring marked stone was found in pit within the interior of the hillfort. Aitchison (1998) has suggested this rock art dates to the Neolithic/Early Bronze Age. The artefact was deposited in a pit radiocarbon dated to the Late Bronze Age (Mallory 1995).

This structure delimits pit features that contain charred cereal grain, small traces of gold, bronze, glass, stone artefacts and pottery. The gold was 'almost microscopic' in size. They consisted of small fragments of gold leaf or gold wire. Mallory (1995, 80) has suggests that the gold items might represent industrial waste. A large pit in the interior, approximately 2m in diameter and 2.5m deep, contained Late Bronze Age coarse-ware pottery and animal bone (pig, cattle and red deer). The basal deposit of this pit was waterlogged. Worked and perforated wood was recovered from this context (Mallory 2000b, 7).

Although the assemblage is clearly representative of a strong Iron Age presence, coarse-ware pottery discovered underneath the hillfort bank, within the ditch fill and within occupation areas inside the hillfort (Raftery 1969, 91) implies that the original construction and occupation of the hillfort dates to the Late Bronze Age. Raftery (1976, 58 _ 59) later conceded that Freestone Hill was probably constructed in the Late Bronze Age. î Floinn (2000) suggests that the ceramic assemblage, as well as other artifacts, date both the hillfort and the enclosure at its centre to the Late Bronze Age. In particular, the composition of three blue glass beads found within habitation layers on the site are likely to be Late Bronze Age (Henderson 1988, 442). A fourth bead is closely paralleled with Later Bronze Age beads on the continent and from Rathgall hillfort Co. Wicklow (î Floinn 2000, 17).

The inner and middle features are separated by approximately 37m. The middle and outer examples are 35m apart. The enclosing elements do not have a uniform composition. The middle enclosure is the most impressive of the three. It comprises a well preserved inner bank, outer ditch and counterscarp bank best preserved to the south. The bank and counterscarp are composed mainly of earth. The height of the bank ranges from 2.4m _ 0.5m and is on average 7m wide. The ditch ranges from 2.9m _ 1.3m in depth from the top of the inner bank to bottom of the ditch and is on average 7m wide. The counterscarp ranges from 0.4m _ 0.9m in height and is on average 3m wide. There is no evidence for stone revetment, although recent excavation suggests that this may have originally been present. A large number of small breaks occur throughout the perimeter, although these are most likely modern. Recent excavation suggests that the earthen bank and ditch was constructed over a palisaded enclosure which may have been similar to the inner and outer enclosing elements. The inner rampart comprises a low-rise rubble stone bank with no corresponding ditch. The bank is on average 0.2m in height and 6m wide.

Two of these were dated; structure 8 (930 _ 810 BC)  and 5 (350 _ 1 BC)  (Cotter 2012b, 230). Cleary (2012, 9) notes that there is a minimum of 340 vessels from these excavations, the bulk of which came from layers that seem to have been deposited mainly in the period 1000 _ 800 cal. BC. Other likely Late Bronze Age finds included 460 fragments of clay crucible moulds. Eight types of instruments or weapons were definitively identified from moulds, including 1 sword, 2 spearheads, 3 socketed axe-heads, 2 knives, 2 ball pinheads, 4 disc heads or decorated studs/buttons, 4 pin shanks and 2 rings/bracelets (OCarroll 2012a). Further evidence for the casting of these items is apparent in the 28 sherds of crucibles of varying size and form. Traces of copper-alloy identified on the outer surface of one complete example attests to their use (OCarroll 2012b).  A large corpus of finds was recovered, mainly from the inner enclosure, including 40 bronze objects, the most famous of which are the four Bronze rings (Cotter 2012b, 48 _ 49). 17 pieces of amber, the majority in the form of beads (Feeney-Johnson 2012, 93) attest to potential continental trade networks. Analysis of these confirm that, with the exception of one example, all amber finds were made from Baltic succinate (Feeney-Johnson 2012, 96). 14 Iron Age/Early Medieval blue glass beads attest to later occupation of the hillfort (Fitzgerald and Warner 2012). Numerous stone, bone and iron implements were also recovered from the site.         The fish bone assemblage from D–n Aonghasa constitutes the largest collection of Bronze Age fish bone in Ireland (McCarthy 2012, 172). These bones, in combination with large quantities of recovered shells, indicate exploitation of nearby marine resources. The identification of eleven different species of fish reflects the variety available in the vicinity of the site (McCarthy 2012, 173). This unique availability of faunal resources at the Aran Islands is partly the result of the islands being at the meeting of northern and southern temperate waters, where species from both bodies meet and mix (OConnell and Roden 1994, 47). It is clear, however, that the most important economic activity was pastorial (McCarthy 2012, 173).",Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,NO APPARENT FEATURES,7.0,,3.0,"These three gaps are likely to represent the original Late Bronze Age entrances.

There is a blocked-up gate at the NE of the second enclosing element. Two further entrance gaps at the N are likely to be later in date (Cotter 2012a, 51 - 58). Break in third enclosing element at NW. Break in outer enclosing elements at the N (Cotter 2012a).","The inner wall survives to a height of 4.9m and varies from 3.5m to 5.8m in width at its base, although this enclosing element has been rebuilt in relatively recent times, with the addition of external buttresses. This enclosure surrounds an area of 0.15ha. The wall has two internal tiers with access provided by a number of steps which are built into the wall (Cotter 2012a, 54). A sample of animal bone from residue on a sherd of pottery from an occupation layer deposited «soon after the construction of the abutting inner enclosing element of the hillfort returned a date of 980_810 BC (Cotter 2012a, 158 _ 163; Warner 2012, 224). Underneath this layer, another occupation surface returned a date of 1070_890  BC (Cotter 2012a, 158; Warner 2012, 224). These lay underneath the «refurbishment of the inner enclosure, where the walls of the enclosing element were thickened by 3_4m (Cotter 2012a, 171).  The middle enclosing element survives to a height of 4m and varies from 1.6m to 3.8m in width at its base. It abuts the northern portion of the inner wall and encloses an area of 0.92ha mainly to the east of the inner enclosure. Dating evidence for the construction of this wall comes from occupation refuse underneath the lower terrace of wall 1. Two radiocarbon samples dating to 130 _1050  BC and 1250_1000 BC are supported by samples from contexts after the construction of the wall which date to 1080_510 BC, confirming these two dates as likely to be representative of the initial construction of the hillfort (Cotter 2012a, 64; Warner 2012).  The outer wall survives to a maximum height of 1.5m. While this is substantially lower than the other potentially contemporary enclosing elements, the outer wall is built along a terrace for most of its length. This further augmented the outer wall, by making it appear more defensible from the exterior. The remains of an internal terrace is visible at the N and NW section. Much of the outer enclosing element is decapitated, with only the northern and eastern sections remaining upstanding. The outer wall was not dated, and there is no evidence to suggest if this is contemporary or later than the middle and inner enclosing elements (Cotter 2012a, 88), although Cotter (2012a, 88) suggests that it is unlikely to post-date the chevaux de frise, as this feature cuts off the outer enclosure from the rest of the hillfort.   A broad band of chevaux de frise (0.6ha of closely spaced upright stone pillars) is positioned immediately outside the middle enclosure. This is rare in an Irish context. A fourth wall partially survives (63m in length) abutting the NW edge of the chevaux de fries. It is likely that this continued further east (to about 0.92ha), although upon excavation, there was no definitive evidence for this (Cotter 2012a, 134 _ 135). The wall survives to an average height of 2m and ranges from 1.5m to 2.6m in width. Although both of these features are undated, Cotter (2012a, 55) suggests that they belong to a separate, later phase of activity at the site.",0.15,0.72,0.92,5.7,5.7,5.85,No,,No,,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,,No,,No,0.0,,No,None.,"Cotter, C. 2012a.

A larger 30m break occurs in the inner enclosure. Here, the hillfort builders integrated a naturally wet/marshy area (Mullins 2008, 26). The area was covered in colluvial deposits, confirming this was a marshy area for a prolonged period. Deposited in this area was a La T_ne copper alloy artifact of unknown function (Mullins 2008, 26).","Upon excavation, the ditches of the hillfort were revealed to be U shaped, up to 4m wide and 1.5m deep, with the outer and inner elements being more substantial than the middle (Mullins 2008, 26). All three ditches of the hillfort were re-cut, most likely in the Late Bronze Age, intimating that maintenance of the hillfort was undertaken at some stage shortly after it was constructed. The outer enclosing element of the hillfort comprises a ditch-bank-ditch arrangement. Evidence for an intervening bank was identified on the W section of the hillfort (Mullins 2008, 26). No artifactual or radiocarbon evidence is available to suggest a construction date for this bank. Ditch in-fill layers suggest the presence of a bank accompanying both the middle and inner ditches (Mullins 2008, 26). Sherds of Late Bronze Age coarse-ware pottery and a damaged polished stone axe were recovered from the inner ditch, while a damaged bone needle and whetstone were found in the outer ditch (Mullins 2008, 26). Interestingly, animal bone was also recovered from the ditch fills, most notably dog bone and a complete deer skeleton (Mullins 2008).

Simple gap 0.9m wide on the SE side may be original. This narrow passage is internally faced and comprises an angled passage through the bank.  The passage is flanked with roughly coursed blocks and about midway, the passage turns sharply. Narrow horns flank the gap on the outside, forming a funnel extending in towards the gap (Grogan 2005a, 141). A single 2.4m gap in the outer enclosing elements at the SW may be original (Grogan 2005a, 122). This gap is flanked by by external in-curving hornworks  extending from the terminals of both banks.","The hillfort comprises three widely spaced limestone rubble banks, occupying a total area of 11.05ha. The banks largely follow the contours of the hill, taking advantage of naturally steep slopes to make the defences seem larger from the exterior. The inner enclosing element surrounds a sub-circular area 0.76ha. in extent. The stone bank varies from 6_9m in width and is on average 1.5m in height (Grogan 2005a, 118). There is no apparent ditch feature. A single radiocarbon date was taken from animal bone mixed within the inner bank material, dating to 922_813 BC (Grogan 2005a, 144).  The middle enclosing element is roughly concentric with the inner example and occupies an area of 2.88ha. The bank is 8_11m wide and rises to a height of 3.5m on the exterior and 2m internally (Grogan 2005a, 119). Again, there is no apparent ditch feature. A smaller concentric wall placed 3m inside the main bank can be traced for 80m, however, it is unknown how this relates to the main period of hillfort occupation (Grogan 2005a, 120). A series of radiocarbon dates were attained for the middle enclosing element (see Grogan 2005a, Table 6.1) dating the original construction of the bank to 1125_918 BC, with subsequent alterations occurring  between 1000 BC to 800 BC (Grogan 2005a, 186).  The outer enclosing element is oval and encloses an area of 11.05ha. It comprises a large inner bank, 12_15m wide, an intervening ditch 5m in average width, and a smaller outer bank (Grogan 2005a, 121). A charcoal sample from a burnt surface directly underneath the bank, but outside the «setting-out line effectively dates the construction of this enclosing element to 1255_917 BC (Grogan 2005a, 188). Grogan (2005a, 128) suggests that the radiocarbon dates for the three enclosing elements imply that they were likely conceived of, constructed and functioned at the same time.",0.76,2.88,10.85,,10.85,11.05,No,,Yes,,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,Yes,Stone rubble banks,No,,Yes,1.0,Accompanying outer enclosure,No,None.,"Westropp, T. 1893.

Interestingly, evidence for the re-use of the monument in the Late Iron Age was revealed by radiocarbon dates from the gravel capping of the bank (8 ± 130 BC) and a post-hole driven into the top of the bank (154 ± 55 AD) (Simpson and Gibson, 215).",6.11,,,,6.11,6.25,No,,Yes,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,,No,,No,0.0,No obvious ditch feature recorded.,No,None.,"Evans, E. 1953.

Upon excavation the enclosing elements were shown to comprise a ditch-bank-ditch arrangement, although several phases of construction were noted by Proudfoot (1954, 97_98), potentially ranging from the Late Bronze Age to Medieval periods. Upon excavation, the inner ditch measured 3.3m wide and almost 2.4m deep (Proudfoot 1954, 100). Proudfoot (1955, 66) suggests that the inner ditch is of slightly later date, and that the bank and outer ditch are contemporary. A small counterscarp bank was also noted on the outside of the ditch.           A series of post-holes at the edge of the exterior bank face, suggest a palisade was used to contain an earthen bank (Proudfoot 1954, 98 _ 99). No charcoal was present inferring the palisade had decayed in-situ. Further excavations revealed that a similar setting of post-holes abutting the inner face of the bank was linked to the outer example by a series of shallow transverse trenches which have been interpreted as the bedding trenches for tie-beams (Proudfoot 1955a, 59), although this seems to be a later «re-furbishment of the enclosing elements and not an original feature.

Warner (2009, 512) confusingly states his conclusion, Çunproven and pending further evidence, is that the hillfort at Clogher is very likely to be of Iron Age date. This is in contrast to earlier summary reports that suggest a Late Bronze Age date (Warner 1971; 1972; 1973; 1974; 1975; 1979). Coarse ware pottery Çprobably relates to phase I (Warner 1972), the phase of hillfort construction. This type of pottery, as stated previously, can be firmly dated to the Late Bronze Age. Large pits containing this pottery were revealed at the centre of the hillfort and were Çapparently bounded by a drystone Çcashel-like wall (Warner 1974). Warner suggests that these are possibly Late Bronze Age in date (Warner 1974). Warners summary of excavations between 1977_1979 infer that a radiocarbon date from the old ground surface underneath this central enclosure dates to the Late Bronze Age (Warner 1979).

Westropp describes this coastal promontory as a 'platform fort' having a deep natural hollow across the neck, usually crossed by a narrow gangway (1914, 104). Excavation by O'Kelly indicated that the earliest phase of activity on the site was the deep ditch that cut across the narrow neck of land that separated the site from the mainland.

879,901,IR,Republic of Ireland,"IR0901 Downmacpatrick (Old Head), Cork",Downmacpatrick (Old Head),,"Downmacpatrick (Old Head), Cork",Archaeological Survey of Ireland SMR Database,CO137A001001,,CO 137,,,"This promontory is situated on the S coast of Co. Cork at the 'Old Head of Kinsale' between Courtmacsherry Bay and Kinsale Harbour, c. 6km SE of Ballinspittle village. Depicted as 'Downmacpatrick or the Old Head' on the first edition OS six-inch map (1840). Early historical references to D–n Cermna on the Old Head are documented by O'Rahilly (1939,16-20) who identifies it as an important Pre-Christian settlement,one of the two main strongholds of an Iron Age tribe known as the Ñrainn (Iverni). It can be described as an oval headland of c.84 ha connected to the mainland via a narrow neck, across which are the remains of a fifteenth century stone built fortification composed of a tower house and  curtain wall (118m long) fronted by a substantial rock-cut ditch c. 6m wide and 2.4m deep (Westropp 1914, 120; Power et al. 1994). An entrance gateway is recorded through the curtain wall, accessed via a modern road. Though the masonry defence is evidently late-medieval in date, Westropp suggested  the impressive external ditch 'may very probably be a remnant of the earlier promontory fort' (Westropp 1914, 122); this hypothesis is now contradicted by excavation (below). Although no apparent traces of prehistoric habitation are evident on the headland itself, many features such as hut-sites were visible before it was reclaimed and ploughed in the 1970. Prior to the development of a golf course on the headland during the 1990s archaeological monitoring, excavation and geophysical prospection was undertaken in selective areas of the promontory in order to prevent accidental damage to the buried archaeological features. This work showed Çlittle of archaeological interest and most anomalies were of geological rather than archaeological origin. A rectangular enclosure with traces of internal huts-structures on the SW side of the promontory was excluded from the development and fenced off (Cleary 2001, 10). The excavation of the site was confined to the area around the entrance with two trenches excavated across the outer ditch on the N side of the castle. The investigation concluded that the ditch located outside and to the N of the castle was probably cut at the same time as the medieval fortifications were constructed (Cleary 2001, 12). The depositional sequence of medieval dump material related to the castle's occupation appeared to be continuous and there was no evidence for any intermediary sod layers indicating phases of regeneration. It was apparent to Cleary that the infilling of the ditch was relatively continuous over a short period of time with no evidence of re-cutting or enlargement from an earlier feature.

Waterford. Known as ÇGullys Islands, this triangular grass-covered headland projects SW from the mainland into the Atlantic at an altitude of 5m OD. The landmass is cut off on the landward side by an eroded earthen bank which runs in an E-W direction for c. 35m. It is 6m in width and has an external height of 1.2m. An external ditch measures 8m in width and has a depth of 0.35m. An Ogham stone was recovered from the ditch in the 1980s while another was found in the 1990s (Manning 1989).

Both appear on earlier editions of OS 6-inch and 25-inch maps (1840). The first line of defence is a wall, situated on the highest point of the headland, where it springs from the mainland at a narrow neck formed between deep ravines. This wall is c. 3m wide, composed of large blocks and swings round cliff edge on the E enclosing the S facing slope dropping down into the promontory from the neck (Redmond 1995, 12; OSullivan and Sheehan 1996, 83). The ground falls away for a distance of about 100m into a saddle from which it rises again into a rocky summit. The second set of defences lies at the base of this slope, comprising an inner wall and three banks and ditches drawn through the saddle over a distance of about 45m. The inner wall is fronted by a deep ditch and a counterscarp bank. The wall has incorporated a mostly sheer rock outcrop, which has been augmented by dry-stone walling 5.5m wide surviving to a maximum of 1.75m high in eleven courses. The ditch is 5.7m wide and 0.97m deep while the counterscarp bank is 0.4m wide. The outer two banks and large ditches of this set of defences are set at an angle to the inner wall, converging towards the W, which may  indicate that they represent a separate phase of construction.

The headland measures 24m from N to S  by 15m and is enclosed at its landward end (N) by two banks and ditches, while along both its E and W margins a low bank can be seen. The outer ditch is not substantial in comparison to the inner, measuring 2.2m wide and 0.64m deep. It does not extend across the entire neck of the headland, and is interrupted by a 7m wide gap in the middle to form a possible entrance. The outer bank is c. 5m wide and standing 2m above the bottom of the inner ditch; a gap through the W portion of this bank is interpreted as a secondary feature.

Kerry, projecting SW into Dingle Bay at an altitude of 87m OD. A distinctive landmass that rises steeply to a rocky ridge extending NE-SW along its spine. It is marked by several rocky outcrops, three of which are incorporated into the defences. The defences, first described by Tim Creedon in 1978 (Redmond 1995, 22), occur about 100m E of the highest point, overlooking the landward approach to the site. They consist of three dry-stone walls that run for a distance of c. 200m continuing downhill to the cliff edge, isolating an area measuring 350m by 320m. The walls are separated by level spaces or slight ditches that step gradually downhill to the exterior. These defences are greatly confused by recent interference and collapse. The inner wall has also been used to create sheep shelters along the inner and outer faces to the N. At the NW end, the outermost line of defence is an earthen bank which may correspond with the third wall elsewhere. The outermost wall is 2 courses high and 1m and 4.3m wide, while the middle one, 1.3m away, is two courses high (0.8m) and 1.55m wide. The third wall is 3-4 courses high (1.15m) and 2.9m wide (Cuppage 1986, 90; Redmond 1995, 22). Three entrances are recorded along the line of defences. The two examples to the N are now blocked but are interpreted as original features due to the presence of facing forming the sides (O'Sullivan and Sheehan 1996, 92). The third entrance to the S does not break through the inner wall, therefore, it is unclear whether this is an original feature; its causeway crosses the outer lines but extends only as far as the level berm which separates these from the inner wall in this area. Within the interior of the promontory, extending W from the walls along the spine of the promontory are 14-15 hut sites. These are sub-rectangular, oval and circular, while some are conjoined composed of dry-stone walling or stony banks. They vary in internal diameter from 2m to 6m.

Kerry and projecting SW from the mainland, this long headland measures over 500m NE-SW and contains one of the most complex promontory forts in Co. Kerry, with two lines of defences, a tower-house and many possible hut-sites. The site is recorded on the first edition six-inch OS map (1841). The narrow peninsula decreases in width from 100m at the landward end to only a few metres at Doon point and is situated at an altitude of 6m OD. The outer line of defences at the landward side consists of two banks with a large medial ditch spanning the neck between two inlets. A 5.8m wide causeway crosses these near the centre, providing access to the interior. The outer bank is 14m wide, rising c. 1.5m above the external ground level and c. 6m above the base of the ditch, which is c. 5m wide. An earthen field boundary, 0.5m high runs along the top of this bank (Cuppage 1986, 87; O'Sullivan and Sheehan 1996, 87). The inner bank is 4.5m wide and 3m high internally and rises 3.8m above the ditch. A sub-rectangular depression in the N end of this bank is interpreted as a possible guard-chamber; it measures 5m by 4m and is enclosed by a low bank of earth and stone. The ditch decreases in depth to either side of the central causeway and is wider and deeper where it meets the cliff faces. The remains of a medieval tower house known as Ferriters Castle are located on the S side of the causeway at the end of the inner bank. A modern stone wall skirts the N side of the promontory between the two lines of defences and the E end has evidently been cultivated. Nevertheless, low earthen banks NW of the castle appear to define a rectangular house site of possible medieval date. This measures 6.2m by 3.5m, while another is recorded a short distance to the SW measuring 3.5m by 8m. A more definite house-site is recorded on the N edge of the promontory measuring 7m by 1.6m and is internally divided.  The defences midway along the promontory to the SW are composed of three banks and two intermediate ditches traversed by a causeway 4m wide. The outer bank is 1m high by 4m wide and is incorporated into a field fence. The middle bank lies 4.4m to the W,  and is 1.88m high by 8m wide, standing 2.63m above the bottom of the outer ditch. The inner bank is 5m wide and stands 3.42m high above the base of the inner ditch, but only 0.13m above the level of the interior. Some masonry is recorded on the SE cliff below the inner bank. Nine circular hut-sites are recorded within this enclosed area. They vary in size from 2.5m by 3m to 5.6m by 6.5m and appear to be cut into the underlying bedrock and enclosed by low earth and stone banks, one of which is revetted with upright stone slabs (O'Sullivan and Sheehan 1996, 89).

It is c. 4.5km SW of Ventry town, Co. Kerry. To the W of the fort and along its E edge are several small streams which run off the foothills of Mount Eagle into Dingle Bay. The site is recorded on the first edition six-inch OS map (1841) and second editions (1914-15) as  'Dunbeg'.  It can be described as a roughly triangular promontory of c. 0.52ha, defended on the N by an inner drystone wall with four outer lines of banks, five ditches; the wall has a complex entrance flanked by two guard chambers. A souterrain extends under the causeway from this entrance and in the interior is a single clochaun or dry-stone building. After the fort was acquired by the Office of Public Works (OPW), the defences were re-built and modified in places.  It has suffered extensive erosion since it was first recorded in the early 19th century by John Windele (1848, 472-77). As a result, in 1977, the OPW initiated an excavation which was conducted a few years later (Barry 1981, 295-329). The overall plan of the defences is somewhat confused by the later alterations. Excavation revealed that the banks were made up of re-deposited yellow brown clay with a mix of small stones. These banks stood to a height of up to lm above the old ground level and were up to 3m wide (Barry 1991, 303). Tentative traces of a palisade trench were found on the N facing crest of the inner bank and possibly along the N face of the next bank, while there were also indications of possible stone facing on the N sides of both banks (ibid., 303). Portions of the 2 outer banks lie outside a boundary wall constructed in the 1890's, and their line is now barely perceptible. The ditches range in depth from 0.98m to 1.55m below the old ground surface and are 5.6m to 12m wide. Most of the fill of these ditches was made up of a yellowy grey clay deposit that was up to 0.9m deep. Ditch 1 however had a different profile from the others as it was deeper and had more steeply sloping sides. The fill was also different, being made up of an extensive stone infill up. A sample of wood charcoal was taken from the base of this ditch for radiocarbon dating, which produced a date of 691-1018 cal AD. This would strongly indicate that this ditch was in use in the eighth and ninth centuries AD. A number of breaks recorded in the earthen banks are a result of the removal of N/S field fences that once crossed the defences. A possible original entrance is recorded centrally with a causeway 1.2m wide. Upright slabs lined the edges of this and a few of these still survive towards the S end. Over half of the original interior has probably been destroyed by erosion on the W  The inner stone rampart is up to 6.35m thick and 3.08m high, extending across the promontory for 29m. This is only about half the length recorded in 1856 by Du Noyer (1858, 2) as much of the W half has fallen into the sea. The rampart seems, however, to have been preceded by an earlier shallow ditch or trench which ran for a known length of 19m. Barry suggests that a layer of charcoal along the whole length of the ditch, and immediately under the topsoil, could be explained by the burning and consequent collapse of a wattle fence. A radiocarbon date of 797-539 BC  was obtained from a sample of this charcoal layer. The early plans and descriptions of the site indicate a straight wall running from cliff edge to cliff edge (Du Noyer 1858; Pitt-Rivers c. 1865). At present there is a curved terminal to the E end of the rampart and a similar terminal existed at the W end prior to its erosion. There appears to have been 2 construction phases. Phase 1 is represented by the inner half of the wall; this measures 4.8m in width and 2.76m in height and has 3 terraces along its inner face. The lintelled entrance passage is 2m wide and 2.3m high with slightly corbelled side walls. Two small chambers are incorporated within the thickness of the wall on either side of this.  At a later stage the exterior capstone of the passage cracked and pillars were inserted along the E side wall to give support. The passage was also extended outwards, but was reduced in width and height to .92m and 1.24m respectively. At the same time the adjacent ditch was deepened. The upcast soil was piled against the outer face of the rampart to form the core of a strengthening wall measuring 1.75 to 2.25m wide and 1.9m high.   A stone flagged pathway leads from the entrance in the rampart to a clochaun in the interior of the fort. The clochaun, circular in plan outside and rectangular inside, has an internal diameter of 7.5m and is a maximum of 2.3m high. The lintelled doorway faces NW. Two major phases of occupation were recorded during the excavation of the clochaun. The 1st phase was centered on a small hearth close to its S wall. Clusters of stake holes to N and S probably indicate the presence of tripods for supporting pots or skins over the fire.  The 2nd occupation layer lay 0.18 to 0.3m above the 1st and was concentrated on 2 hearths in the centre of the clochaun. The bones of sheep, pig, deer, birds and fish were recovered. Several post-holes and numerous stake holes were also recorded. Although the walls corbel inwards, Barry considered the span too great to have supported a corbelled roof and suggests that the structure may never have been roofed. Instead lean-to shelters may have been erected in the NW, SE and SW corners with 2 of the sides supported by the clochaun walls and the other sides by wooden posts. Dates of 1050±65 BP (UB-2218, 784-1156 cal AD) and 960±100 BP (UB-2217, 891-1263 cal AD) from the occupation layers in the clochaun, suggest it was inhabited in the 10th or 11th centuries AD.

The first written survey of the fort is to be found in the writings of the Cork antiquary, John Windele, who visited it in 1848. Windele reported that the stone rampart 'extends in a straight line 'and that in his day the entrance-way was in its centre with the two' creeps' on either side. In 1856 George Du Noyer visited the site and two years later he published a report on it which included a plan of the fort showing, again, that the rampart wall cut off the end of the promontory in a straight line with chambers on either side of the entrance-way. In 1892, the fort was acquired by the Commissioners of Public Works from a Mr Charles Drummond as a National Monument (No. 177). As a result of this, a programme of reconstruction work was undertaken. As well as all the reconstruction work, the dry-stone walls of three leaseholders' fields that crossed the fort in a north south direction were also removed. A boundary wall, gate and stile were constructed around the perimeter of the fort to protect it and to mark out the area of the National Monument. From June to September 1977 the site was partially excavated by Terry Barry. The areas chosen for investigation included cutting sections through the landward earthen defences, and almost the entirety of the main stone rampart and the cloch_n (Barry 1981). Site later surveyed by the Kerry Archaeological Survey (Cuppage 1986).","Two guard chambers are recorded flanking the lintelled entrance through the stone rampart. They measure 2.3 x 1.4m x almost 2m high (E chamber) and 2.4 x 1m x 1.2m high (W chamber). A stone flagged pathway leads from the entrance in the rampart to a clochaun in the interior of the fort. The clochaun, circular in plan outside and rectangular inside, is 7.5m across the interior and is a maximum of 2.3m high. The lintelled doorway faces NW. Two major phases of occupation were recorded during the excavation of the clochaun.

Excavation revealed that the banks were made up of re deposited yellow brown clay with a mix of small stones. These banks stood to a height of up to lm above the old ground level and were up to 3m wide (Barry 1991, 303). Tentative traces of a palisade trench were found on the N facing crest of the inner bank and possibly along the N face of the next bank while there were also indications of possible stone facing on the N sides of both banks (ibid., 303). The ditches range in depth from 0.98m to 1.55m below the old ground surface and are 5.6m to 12m wide. Most of the fill of these ditches was made up of a yellowy grey clay deposit that was up to 0.9m deep.

Dublin. It is roughly rectangular, projecting E from the mainland at an altitude of 14m OD and has an overall site footprint of 14.32ha. The site is recorded on the first edition six-inch OS map (1837). A belt of at least three banks and ditches have been drawn straight across the root of the headland from N to S over a distance of 350m, before curving round onto the S margin. There are traces of a counterscarp bank in some sectors, though at the northern margin of the headland only the inner bank and its ditch can be seen, and a well is noted in the ditch on OS maps. The inner, earthen bank is stone capped, measuring 10m in width and 1.2m in height, while the denuded outer banks are on average 5m in width and 0.5m in height. The ditches are recorded as being heavily silted up and measured 4m-6m in width and approximately 1m in depth. A stream flows along the outer ditch to debouch on the S. A possible entrance is recorded through these defences at the N end, though it cannot be confirmed whether this is an original feature. An eighteenth century martello tower is situated within the interior at the E end of the headland and an access road constructed to it from the WSW, crossing the S end of the defences. A sherd of Gallo-Roman pottery was found in a disturbed context at the site in the 1970s and recently two second-century, Roman coins were found in ploughed land close to the fort; other Roman material from the site may be contained in a large collection of metalwork finds currently held by the National Museum, but are inaccessible under a legal embargo.

Donegal. Composed of a series of connected, rocky peninsulas projecting N from the mainland, the landmass is the highest part of Tory Island and roughly measures 700m in overall length N-S by between 50m and 220m E-W. These indented peninsulas are enclosed by a series of stone and earthwork elements, within which a number of possible structures and hut-sites are visible, one of which was investigated during the 1940's (Sidebotham 1949, 98-103). The OS 6-inch maps depict the site of a castle overlooking the neck of the peninsula at the S end, recorded by O'Donovan in 1835 as a modern square castle of lime and stone (O'Flanagan 1927, 57). There are no visible remains of this castle and it is not clear what connection if any it had with the southernmost enclosure of the peninsular, comprising a stone wall (Lacey 1983, 226). Drawn in a concave arc above the low neck 40m wide that forms a natural ditch separating the peninsular from the mainland, the remains of this grass-covered stone wall are c. 40m long and 2m wide, and range in height from 0.5m to 1m. Cutting off the whole peninsula, this in effect encloses an area of about 7.9ha on the upper surface.  Within this outer part of the peninsula, which extends to about 4ha, the area is subdivided approximately 80m E of the neck. by a bank of earth and stone c. 3m wide and 1m high running for a distance of 105m NW-SE from the cliff edge on the SE side, before petering out on the top of the peninsula. An external ditch associated with the bank on its SW side is  c. 2m wide and 0.5m deep and there is a 3m to 4m wide entrance gap 45m from its SE end (Lacey 1983, 226). N of this entrance is a c. 10m square enclosure built up against the bank and formed of grass-grown earth and stone banks, while a further 10m N a band of water-rolled beach stones c. 0.5m to 1m wide runs E. The latter forms one of a series of such features in this area and includes an approximately 8m square enclosure formed by lines of stones. A little further N, set out over a distance of 60m in a line running E and W, the remains of four small, stone-built enclosures or huts can be seen; a possible well lies nearby.  To the N the peninsula narrows to another isthmus (c. 40m wide E-W and 60m long N-S) where an impressive series ramparts and ditches have been constructed, referred to as 'Balor's Fort' on the OS 6-inch maps. Four earthen banks and at least three intermediate ditches, and possibly with a fourth outer ditch, rising above each other with the trend of the natural slope to the N. There is some evidence for a possible stone revetment on the inner side of the innermost bank on the N. A causeway cuts across these defences on the W and narrows from 5m wide on the S to 2m on the N or inner end (Lacey 1983, 226). Behind these defences the peninsula widens to c. 220m E-W before constricting to another neck about 100m to the N, and scattered over the S facing slopes in this area are the remains of at least twenty hut-sites, some of which are know on the island as 'Diarmuid and Grania's'  Partially protected by the higher ground to the N, they are typically defined by roughly circular depressions within low banks. A rock-cut well is also recorded in this area. Beyond the neck to the N, an arm of land, annotated 'The Anvil' on the second edition OS six-inch map, projects out from the island to a narrow blade-edge, tower of rock, called 'Tormore', which is virtually inaccessible. The S end of this projection consists of a level area of land defined by sheer cliff edges, to which access is barred from the W by a rock-cut ditch c. 1.5m deep, with possible traces of a internal bank along its E lip (Lacey 1983, 227).

The OS 6-inch maps record the site of a castle on the peninsula to the S, recorded by O'Donovan in 1835 as a modern square castle of lime and stone (O'Flanagan 1927, 57). Two of the twenty or so hut structures recorded in the middle of the landmass were partially investigated by Sidebothem in 1949 who noted that the walls were constructed of stone and earth and some were internally divided. When the surface stones, sods and soil were removed from a part of the hut floor there appeared a layer of 'black clay, the so-called ""blue clay"" common as a flooring material in old Irish cottages' (1949, 102). It formed a layer from four to seven inches thick, and where removed was underlain by small stones set evenly. In this layer of clay in the south-east corner of the inner room, main hut, were found small pieces of charcoal, a few pieces of flint, including a scraper, and a sherd of pottery. The site was surveyed  during the early 1980s for the compilation of the archaeological inventory of Co. Donegal (Lacy 1983).","In the outermost enclosure on the S peninsula there are a c. 10m square enclosure formed of grass-grown earth and stone banks and built up against a bank that subdivides this area. In the vicinity on the N there are several low banks of water-rolled beach stones, including an approximately 8m square enclosure formed by lines of stones. A little further N disposed over a distance of c. 60m from E to W, there are the remains of four small, stone-built enclosures that are probably hut-sites; a possible well is recorded nearby.  On the middle of the peninsula, scattered over the S facing slope behind the main set of defences, there are at least twenty hut-sites, comprising roughly circular depressions enclosed by earth and stone banks; they include  definite hut circles with an overall maximum dimension of c. 10m. A similar site was partially excavated here (Sidebotham 1949, 98--103). Adjacent to one (E of No. 16) is a rock-cut well. On the E arm of the northernmost part of the peninsula there are the remains of a sub-circular collapsed stone enclosure c. 10m in diameter with a gap to the SE.

Cutting off the whole peninsular, this in effect encloses an area of about 7.9ha on the upper surface.  To the N, where the peninsula narrows to another isthmus an impressive series of four ramparts have been constructed, with at least three intermediate ditches, and possibly with a fourth outer ditch. The crests of the ramparts rise progressively above each other with the trend of the natural slope to the N.

Antrim. It is bounded to the E by cliffs culminating in the promontory of Fair Head, some 200m high, and to the W by a headland of basalt some 60m high. The River Margy flows into the bay at its W end. It has superb views all round. The visible remains comprise an almost level triangular area 30m N-S by 45m wide and falls away down the cliff everywhere except the SE, where the neck is enclosed by a rock-cut ditch and there are elements of a masonry castle with a wall and gatehouse built in basalt bonded with coarse mortar. According to McNeill (2004), the remains of at least two structures survive in the interior and there are probable traces of others. Excavation of the site in 2004 revealed a more complex history. A trench was excavated across the expected line of any bank or wall along the inner side of the ditch (McNeill 2004, 173). This revealed a pile of large stones up to half-a-metre across lying on a truncated soil. Along the top of this material was a poorly defined shallow scoop filled with dark brown earth. Over the stones to the N lay a deposit of brown earth 0.2m thick. At the S end of the trench between the stones and the lip of the ditch was a narrow berm on which was found a dump of pink clay. McNeill observes that in section, the stones and other associated material have every appearance of being the remains of a truncated bank, lying within the line of the ditch (2004, 173). Two sherds of prehistoric pottery were recovered from the pile of stones in Trench 2. This possible inner bank material was also found in Trench 1 along with the remnant of a turf pile against it. The excavated ditch was some 6m deep and flat bottomed and contained much dumped medieval refuse. McNeill however notes that the flat bottom and near vertical lower sides looked as though they had been made as a result of quarrying the basalt for stone, presumably for the medieval gate structure (2004, 182). Higher in the ditch the sides were less vertical and McNeill suggests that this sloping upper section may be the remains of an earlier ditch, later deepened, and this may relate to the remains of the truncated bank and inner turf pile. This early phase may have been a late prehistoric or protohistoric promontory fort reoccupied as a base for a small detachment of troops in the late sixteenth century (ibid).

Antrim. It has been largely destroyed by quarrying, but projects N between Boheesshane Bay and Larrybane Bay. The promontory is composed of chalk, overlooking Sheep Island with extensive views of Rathlin Island to the NE and good views up and down the coastline to the NW and SE respectively. An exposed site, the promontory falls away sheer down the cliffs some 40m to the sea on the W and N, while on the SE it is no bounded by the face of the quarry which resumed at the site during the 1950s. Few definite features remain that correspond to Proudfoot's plan drawn in 1960-1, which on the SW shows a curving ditch and an internal stone faced bank cutting off the promontory from the mainland. A section of linear grass-covered stone bank 8m long, 4.5m wide and 0.8m high at SE is possibly a remnant of the original rampart. Outside this are the remains of a possible ditch, while to the W are a further length of a possible ditch at the W margin of the promontory; the latter is c. 10m in length, c. 4m wide and 1m in depth. It was first excavated by Gordon Childe in 1935, who, working in the W part of the interior, was able to distinguish ""over a comparatively small area"" at least four phases of occupation ""on and in, as well as under"" the rampart debris (Proundfoot and Wilson 1960-1, 93). The site was later excavated in the 1960s by Proudfoot and Wilson who cut sections revealing the  stone-faced rampart and external ditch on the landward side. The rampart was composed of large basalt boulders which rested on blue clay. The inner and outer stone facing consisted of flat stones up to 6 courses high in places. A large quantity of small chalk stones were found in layers that sloped up to the face of the bank, which Proudfoot and Wilson suggest must have been originally piled on top of stone rampart (1960-1, 95). The ditch had been cut through the boulder clay and underlying chalk bedrock. In 1838 Fagan recorded the ditch as '23 feet wide, and the top of the rampart stood 8 to 12 ft. above its bottom'. Within the interior of the site, a number of hearths were found but no building outlines, suggesting to Proudfoot and Wilson that houses were composed of turf (ibid., 105).

Clare, forming a T-shaped peninsula at a height of 6m OD and known as 'Horse Island'. The top of the island is wedge-shaped, measuring 267m E W by a maximum of 83m N-S at the W end, and it is connected to the mainland by a narrow neck that contracts from 17m wide to little more than 4m. The inner defences are the more substantial and consist of a ditch, 4.5m wide and 1.5 deep, with a stone wall along its inner edge. The outer line consists of an earthen bank with at least one, and possibly two, external ditches (Lynch and Jones 2009, 57).  Westropp noted that a ditch was cut across the neck of this approach and was associated with a dry-stone wall and earthen bank (1908, 226), but the only internal features he recorded were hollows used for burning seaweed to make kelp. That said, a number of shell middens near the entrance were recorded by him, and midden material is eroding out of the fill of a ditch at the neck. The rapid erosion of the promontory fort defences on the narrow isthmus leading from the mainland led to a rescue excavation in 2006 (Lynch 2009, 57). The excavation of Trench A was carried out to examine the stone wall on the inner edge of the inner ditch, where, beneath several layers of stones and sediments, the 0.5m-high remains of a mortared stone wall were revealed. This wall formed the eastern side of an entrance to the promontory. The wall was over 1m wide and the entranceway had a curving splay that widened towards the interior. An in situ stone with a Çmortise hole protruded from the base of the wall into the entranceway at the outer edge of the entrance (this may have held a wooden element of the doorway, such as a jamb). The entranceway appeared to be cobbled. Samples of limpet shell, charcoal, burnt and unburnt bone were recovered from the exposed ditch section in the cliff face. Trench B was excavated to examine and record the outer defences of the promontory fort, which appeared at first to consist of a single bank and ditch.  Exposed in this excavation trench was an earthen bank with an external ditch.

It is located in an area of rough sheep grazing and open bogland. First described in 1752, the coastal promontory has been visited by many with tradition suggesting that it was built by the burkes and besieged and taken by the Danes. Others state that it was built 'in the time of Queen Elizabeth' while local folklore suggests that during the 'battle of Cross' the local inhabitants penned their cattle in the headland for safety, hence the name 'cattle fort' (Pococke 1752; Trotter 1819; O'Donovan 1838; Browne 1895; Westropp 1912, 201). The defences consist of an inner stone rampart, an external ditch and a low outer or counterscarp bank running across the neck of the headland. Outside this, to the E are what has been interpreted as the remains of chevaux de frise, which have been dismissed more recently as the remains of a children's burial ground (Casey 1999). It was described as of 'great height and size' in 1817, but reduced in size by the natives who took many of the pillar stones for lintels and sills (Otway 1845). The inner wall is a massive dry-stone structure of thin slabs, extending 15m to the NE and 19.8m to the SW of the central gateway. It is 6m wide in the middle, reducing to 4.2m to the NE; it is up to 2.4m high at the SW end, and in places its crest stands up to 5.1m above the bottom of the ditch. The ditch exploits a natural fault on the SW and a broken cleft on the NE which has been cut away by the sea; it is up to 6.7m wide at the top and 1.8m at the base at a depth of 2.1m, but is partly filled with rubble that has spilled down from the inner wall. On the NE side of the entrance the outer bank is 5m in width and up to 1.2m high. The entrance causeway across the ditch is flanked by grass-covered banks on either side, and there are recumbent flagstones lying on either side of the gap in the main wall; two mural/guard chambers described by Westropp flanking the entrance are no longer visible, but a circular depression on the NE side of the causeway, which is 4.5m in diameter, may be the remains of a circular hut guarding the entrance (Casey 1999, 67). Within the interior, two smaller depressions immediately inside the main wall on the SW of the entrance may be the remains of conjoined huts, while immediately to the N of the entrance is another possible hut-site. The interior of the fort rises up to its highest point near the W end of the promontory, where, about 75m from the defences, the remains of a possible stone cashel-type enclosure measuring c. 36m in diameter can be seen. Its wall survives only on the E and N, where it is up to 4m thick and up to 0.8m high. Nearer to the entrance are the remains of a possible rectangular building composed of stone.  A single trench was cut across the line of defences in 1992 (Casey 1999). The excavation revealed that the main bank was originally faced on both sides with an internal rubble core. Tentative remains of terracing was also revealed. The ditch was V-shaped with steep sides and was partly rock-cut, revetted along its outer face with 4-5 courses of stonework.

When viewed from the mainland it is dominated by a small church and by nineteenth century fortifications in the form of a gun battery and Martello tower on the S end. The name 'Dalke'y appears to be a Norse translation of the Irish name 'Deilginis' or 'Thorn Island' (Ofedal 1975; Doyle 1998). The promontory fort comprises a small headland cut off On the SE by a low bank with a partially back-filled external ditch enclosing an area of approximately 0.25ha. It is situated at an altitude of 7m OD. Slight evidence of a possible entrance on the SE was recovered during excavation in the 1950's (Liversage 1968); it consisted of several post-holes, including two with stone packing. The interior is divided into two levels by a low granite cliff that runs from N to S. The lower part on the W overlooks the landing area or harbour while the upper on the E is some 3m higher and is more exposed. Excavations revealed that temporary encampments had been intermittently established on the island in the Neolithic and Bronze Age (Liversage 1968). Beneath the promontory fort bank an early medieval shell midden was uncovered, from which sherds of Late Roman Amphorae and three bronze pins were recovered.  Two sherds of Samian Ware, further sherds of Late Roman Amphorae, and Gaulish/Frankish E ware pottery were also recovered during the excavation, and Dalkey Island appears to have continued as an important trading post well into the latter centuries of the early medieval period (Liversage 1968, 179-81). A house, midden and hearth post-dated the promontory fort. Based on finds recovered, it would appear that this house was constructed and abandoned during the early medieval period (O'Sullivan et al. 2010).
