Sometimes called an 'annexe', as appears attached to outer main rampart. Its has been suggested by Brooks and Laws (2006) that this earlier enclosure was overlain by the massive, stepped, stone-walled E rampart of the main enclosure in a second phase to the site and which extended downslope to c. half of present enclosure. Exceptional NE long inturned entrance with guard chamber. A third phase had this extended downslope as an earthen/rubble rampart to complete the present circuit of 2.9ha on the W with simple W entrance. At least three definite roundhouses visible in small enclosure to E and topographical survey suggested at least eight possible hut platforms in the main enclosure. However, subsequent geophysical survey of substantial proportion of the main enclosure, and several of these potential hut platforms, resulted in no evidence of structures.

Very steep to precipitous rocky cliffs on E side, moderate, then steep along the ridge N-S, and steep slopes on W. Possibly two phases suggested in the HER, the first univallate enclosure of c. 1ha, then second univallate enclosure of c. 1.68ha, overlying N half of first site. This is questioned, but visible now is elongated main N enclosure on highest ground, of c. 290m externally N-S, narrowing from c. 84m wide in N to c. 46m wide in S. Rampart now scree or stony bank on W, originally stone wall, with quarry hollows at rear. Opposite, on E side, very steep to precipitous rocky cliffs form boundary. On N, stony bank for short distance, a ditch with tumbled stone, and counterscarp bank. Post-medieval enclosure boundary confuses matters in N, where possible entrance gap. Suggested by Silvester and Hankinson (2006) that this enclosure possibly smaller, as c. 170m from N end bank cuts E across the enclosure and possibly S boundary of N-most of three enclosures, rather than two. If so, a middle enclosure mirrors the stony bank on W and natural cliffs on E as defence, with another stony bank visible across ridge to form S boundary. Out-turned entrance visible on W end of S stony bank. Burnt stone here suggests firing and/or vitrification. Third, and S-most enclosure, not conjoined as N pair are, but c. 10m from the middle S boundary has natural rock outcrop as boundary. This has been called an annexe, or second of two phases, but more likely a separate entity. Its W side, a stony bank, less substantial than banks of the other two N enclosures and has intermittent quarry hollow, with possible ditch in places, becoming more of a scarp as it bends around to form S boundary. On E side, natural cliffs as before, with hint of possible marking-out bank towards N end. In N enclosure, at least eight terraces, probably hut sites. Middle enclosure appears to have none, apart from one post-medieval shelter. Single terrace visible in S enclosure, possibly hut site, but not proven. Rough upland grazing and bare rock and good condition. On 1st Ed. OS map (1889).

Excavations 1910 (Breese 1930) and 1954-6 (Savory 1960), found Iron Age, Roman and early medieval (Dark Age) occupation, with some surviving stone-work possibly medieval.

Route through the three gates torturous, involving blind alleys and zigzags. Razor-back ridge connecting the rock to mountain proper gives straightforward approach. All three ramparts ruinous, once c. 3m thick of rubble faced with laid stone. Where natural slopes sufficient walls absent or much reduced. Between middle and inner ramparts access hindered by natural crag c. 2m high, ending in precipice, only passed by narrow track. No ditches. Partially excavated by H.N.Savory to show main phases of occupation start with possible pre-Roman palisade, followed by early Romano-British phase with 1st century AD pottery. Later Romano-British phase has ceramics and glassware, including late 3rd or 4th century mortaria and colour coated wares. Glassware dated to late or post Roman. Imported amphora and sherd of pottery stamped with chi-rho symbol suggest early medieval use of the site and also period to which ramparts possibly date.

The ramparts of this fort consisted of two banks scarped from the natural hill side with a medial ditch. Possible dry-stone wall running around interior of inner bank.

Within interior to W is massive outcrop of bare rock.

Erosion has now reduced interior to two small promontories, measuring 70m N-S by 25 to E and the 70m NE-SW by 30m to W, enclosing 0.44ha, and already much eroded when Fenton visited in 1808-09.

Three curving inner banks close-set and parallel,c. 120m long, with inner bank to 4m above ditch, second and third less substantial at 1m-2m above ditches. Outer bank c. 20m lower than inner because of slope and is straighter, possibly showing phased construction. Close to cliff edge on E is entrance gap through inner bank. Second and third banks stop short of cliff edge and probably lost to sea. Excavations 1995-98 (Crane and Murphy 2010) found at least seven timber and one stone roundhouses, some rebuilt up to five times.

Steep surrounding slopes, except on S, facing the level hill top. Many questions remain as to whether this very small , roughly oval, site of only 0.8ha, with substantial early medieval connotations, is a settlement/princely llys, as referred to by Alcock, its excavater in 1954-9, or an early medieval settlement, and morphologically a ringwork or small promontory fort, as suggested by RCAHME (Coflein). An early medival defended enclosure would be more appropriate as designated in the HER and by Wiggins and Evans (2005). Alcock considered that this complex sequence was of an earlier, unenclosed, Iron Age settlement, overlain by an early medieval  enclosure and itself overlain by a massively enclosed earthwork castle. To disentangle matters is problematic in the present state of knowledge of the site. Defined by broad rampart with ditch and palisade on N. Three further ramparts on S, one possibly continuing around W side. Inner rampart stone revetted with possible timber-framed breastwork. Second, ditched, rampart less. Two outer ramparts massive, inner stone revetted, and seem to be a pair. Traces of two rectangular buildings, to 7.5m wide, in interior. Entrance at far NW, approached along spine of steep slopes below. Site most notable for its, mostly early medieval, finds, with the largest collection of imported goods, many from distant parts of Europe, of any early medieval site in Wales. Also Roman material and fragments of 12th century pot. Beneath lay fragments of Iron Age pottery. Bank and ditch S from enclosure old field boundary shown, as the site, on the 1st edition OS map (1880). Excavation in 2012 produced C14 date of 2852-2476 cal BC at a 95% probability from buried soil beneath the bank and sherds of late and post-medieval pottery from upper ditch fill. Suggested that area to S of site appears devoid of settlement with no evidence that site extended S (Seaman and Lane 2012).
