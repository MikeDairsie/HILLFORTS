This research was begun in March 2022.<br>

The Hillforts Primer is a research tool that analyses, maps, plots, transforms and adds to the data published in The Atlas of Hillforts of Britain and Ireland (Lock & Ralston, 2017).
The atlas contains 4147 records, with each record having 244 columns of associated information.
The size and shape of the data can make it difficult to manipulate in traditional software so, the aim is to analyse and process the data programmatically, to facilitate interpretation, reuse and machine learning.
