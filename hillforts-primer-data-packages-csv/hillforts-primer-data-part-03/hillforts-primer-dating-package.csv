Although the assemblage is clearly representative of a strong Iron Age presence, coarse-ware pottery discovered underneath the hillfort bank, within the ditch fill and within occupation areas inside the hillfort (Raftery 1969, 91) implies that the original construction and occupation of the hillfort dates to the Late Bronze Age. Raftery (1976, 58 _ 59) later conceded that Freestone Hill was probably constructed in the Late Bronze Age. î Floinn (2000) suggests that the ceramic assemblage, as well as other artifacts, date both the hillfort and the enclosure at its centre to the Late Bronze Age. In particular, the composition of three blue glass beads found within habitation layers on the site are likely to be Late Bronze Age (Henderson 1988, 442). A fourth bead is closely paralleled with Later Bronze Age beads on the continent and from Rathgall hillfort Co. Wicklow (î Floinn 2000, 17).

810,"Downpatrick, Down (Cathedral Hill)","Excavations produced coarse ware from the ditch fill and underneath the hillfort bank (Proudfoot 1954; 1955). Proudfoot (1954) suggests that these sherds are similar to the Late Bronze Age pottery from crannogs at Ballinderry 2, Knocknalappa and Lough Gara. Raftery (1969, 93_94) describes the Downpatrick and Freestone Hill pottery assemblages as Çsuperficially comparable and later (Raftery 1976, 351) dated the hillfort to the Late Bronze Age. Intensive occupation of the hilltop in the Early and High Medieval periods saw the refurbishment of the enclosing elements (Proudfoot 1954, 100). Later trial excavations have led Hamlin and Lynn (1988, 61_64) to suggest that the hillfort is Early Medieval. However, this disregards clear evidence for the re-use of the enclosure in later periods and does not clearly explain the presence of Late Bronze Age pottery directly underneath the bank and in the ditch fill. While no radiocarbon dates are available, the site may be typologically dated to the Late Bronze Age, although intensive occupation of the hilltop during the Early Medieval period may have disturbed these earlier deposits. Three Late Bronze Age hoards found on the hilltop, two of which were found within the hillfort and a possible third of unknown provenance, further attests to activity in the hillfort during this period (Proudfoot 1957; Proudfoot 1955).",NA,Early Christian monastic site,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,C,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No

813,"Clogher, Tyrone (Tobercurry)","Coarse-ware pottery may date the univallate hillfort at Clogher, Co. Tyrone to the Late Bronze Age, and more specifically, to the Dowris phase c. 1000 _ 600 BC (Waddell 1998, 270). Radiocarbon dates confirm occupation of the hilltop during this period (Waddell 1998, 270; 277), although there is considerable evidence for later activity. A recent publication by Warner (2009) suggests that the hillfort is Iron Age, despite the author conceding that dating evidence for the earthwork itself is poor and consists of a single ambiguous artefact and an early medieval radiocarbon date for the primary slippage of the bank material into the ditch (Warner 2009, 510). Warner (2009, 512) confusingly states his conclusion, Çunproven and pending further evidence, is that the hillfort at Clogher is very likely to be of Iron Age date. This is in contrast to earlier summary reports that suggest a Late Bronze Age date (Warner 1971; 1972; 1973; 1974; 1975; 1979). Coarse ware pottery Çprobably relates to phase I (Warner 1972), the phase of hillfort construction. This type of pottery, as stated previously, can be firmly dated to the Late Bronze Age. Large pits containing this pottery were revealed at the centre of the hillfort and were Çapparently bounded by a drystone Çcashel-like wall (Warner 1974). Warner suggests that these are possibly Late Bronze Age in date (Warner 1974). Warners summary of excavations between 1977_1979 infer that a radiocarbon date from the old ground surface underneath this central enclosure dates to the Late Bronze Age (Warner 1979). Warner (2009, 508) has more recently argued that the pottery associated with the enclosure is of an unusual Çclub-rim form which can be dated to the later part of the Dowris phase.",NA,Ringfort and Early Medieval occupation.

Potentially, this might carry the sequence into the early medieval period, particularly if the round-houses in the NW fort, in which a 1st/2nd century enamelled brooch was found, are associated with any of its defences. In practice there is no reason why this should be the case and comparison with other sequences (eg Atlas No.4096) suggests that a post-defensive occupation is inherently more likely.
