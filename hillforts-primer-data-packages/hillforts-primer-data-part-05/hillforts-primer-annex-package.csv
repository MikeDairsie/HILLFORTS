61,"Caynham Camp, Shropshire","There are two, possibly phased, annexes located next to each other at the W end of the hillfort. A bank at the W end of the interior crosses the fort from N to S. Probably originally the W extremity of the fort, an extension of the S rampart to the W and N was constructed to form an annexe. Although entrance gaps to this enclosure exist from the main E part of the site, there appearing to be no obvious entrance into it from the perimeter suggests that the whole hillfort was used as a complete entity. However, this enclosure was later extended itself to the W to form another annexe, with a bank averaging now 2.1m high.

At this entrance the tops of packing stones marking the line of a palisade can be seen protruding through the turf on the crest of the linear earthwork.  A second linear earthwork that approaches the angle of the annexe at this entrance from the S, is cut through it and a radiocarbon date from the primary silts of the annexe ditch indicate its use in the Roman Iron Age.

There are no traces of round-houses within this area. The secondary relationship to the defences of the fort is based on the observation that the inner rampart of the annexe diverts around the inner defences of the fort, but it should be noted that its perimeter in this sector has lost the coherence visible on the NE, the outer rampart with an internal ditch splaying to the W, and the inner flanked by discontinuous quarry ditches on either side for a short distance before the rampart diverts. In short, the perimeter may have been altered here, possibly creating a misleading impression of the relationship between the fort and the annexe.
