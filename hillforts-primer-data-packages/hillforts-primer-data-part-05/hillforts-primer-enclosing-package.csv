The ditch ranges from 2.9m _ 1.3m in depth from the top of the inner bank to bottom of the ditch and is on average 7m wide. The counterscarp ranges from 0.4m _ 0.9m in height and is on average 3m wide. There is no evidence for stone revetment, although recent excavation suggests that this may have originally been present. A large number of small breaks occur throughout the perimeter, although these are most likely modern. Recent excavation suggests that the earthen bank and ditch was constructed over a palisaded enclosure which may have been similar to the inner and outer enclosing elements. The inner rampart comprises a low-rise rubble stone bank with no corresponding ditch. The bank is on average 0.2m in height and 6m wide. Geophysical survey has suggested that the inner and outer enclosing elements were used as the footings for large timber palisades (O'Driscoll 2012). This has been confirmed by excavation (O'Brien 2014).",NA,NA,NA,NA,Pos stone revetted,NA,External ditch associated with the middle enclosing elements. ,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes

This enclosure surrounds an area of 0.15ha. The wall has two internal tiers with access provided by a number of steps which are built into the wall (Cotter 2012a, 54). A sample of animal bone from residue on a sherd of pottery from an occupation layer deposited «soon after the construction of the abutting inner enclosing element of the hillfort returned a date of 980_810 BC (Cotter 2012a, 158 _ 163; Warner 2012, 224). Underneath this layer, another occupation surface returned a date of 1070_890  BC (Cotter 2012a, 158; Warner 2012, 224). These lay underneath the «refurbishment of the inner enclosure, where the walls of the enclosing element were thickened by 3_4m (Cotter 2012a, 171).  The middle enclosing element survives to a height of 4m and varies from 1.6m to 3.8m in width at its base. It abuts the northern portion of the inner wall and encloses an area of 0.92ha mainly to the east of the inner enclosure. Dating evidence for the construction of this wall comes from occupation refuse underneath the lower terrace of wall 1. Two radiocarbon samples dating to 130 _1050  BC and 1250_1000 BC are supported by samples from contexts after the construction of the wall which date to 1080_510 BC, confirming these two dates as likely to be representative of the initial construction of the hillfort (Cotter 2012a, 64; Warner 2012).  The outer wall survives to a maximum height of 1.5m. While this is substantially lower than the other potentially contemporary enclosing elements, the outer wall is built along a terrace for most of its length. This further augmented the outer wall, by making it appear more defensible from the exterior. The remains of an internal terrace is visible at the N and NW section. Much of the outer enclosing element is decapitated, with only the northern and eastern sections remaining upstanding. The outer wall was not dated, and there is no evidence to suggest if this is contemporary or later than the middle and inner enclosing elements (Cotter 2012a, 88), although Cotter (2012a, 88) suggests that it is unlikely to post-date the chevaux de frise, as this feature cuts off the outer enclosure from the rest of the hillfort.   A broad band of chevaux de frise (0.6ha of closely spaced upright stone pillars) is positioned immediately outside the middle enclosure. This is rare in an Irish context. A fourth wall partially survives (63m in length) abutting the NW edge of the chevaux de fries. It is likely that this continued further east (to about 0.92ha), although upon excavation, there was no definitive evidence for this (Cotter 2012a, 134 _ 135). The wall survives to an average height of 2m and ranges from 1.5m to 2.6m in width.

All three ditches of the hillfort were re-cut, most likely in the Late Bronze Age, intimating that maintenance of the hillfort was undertaken at some stage shortly after it was constructed. The outer enclosing element of the hillfort comprises a ditch-bank-ditch arrangement. Evidence for an intervening bank was identified on the W section of the hillfort (Mullins 2008, 26). No artifactual or radiocarbon evidence is available to suggest a construction date for this bank. Ditch in-fill layers suggest the presence of a bank accompanying both the middle and inner ditches (Mullins 2008, 26). Sherds of Late Bronze Age coarse-ware pottery and a damaged polished stone axe were recovered from the inner ditch, while a damaged bone needle and whetstone were found in the outer ditch (Mullins 2008, 26).

The banks largely follow the contours of the hill, taking advantage of naturally steep slopes to make the defences seem larger from the exterior. The inner enclosing element surrounds a sub-circular area 0.76ha. in extent. The stone bank varies from 6_9m in width and is on average 1.5m in height (Grogan 2005a, 118). There is no apparent ditch feature. A single radiocarbon date was taken from animal bone mixed within the inner bank material, dating to 922_813 BC (Grogan 2005a, 144).  The middle enclosing element is roughly concentric with the inner example and occupies an area of 2.88ha. The bank is 8_11m wide and rises to a height of 3.5m on the exterior and 2m internally (Grogan 2005a, 119). Again, there is no apparent ditch feature. A smaller concentric wall placed 3m inside the main bank can be traced for 80m, however, it is unknown how this relates to the main period of hillfort occupation (Grogan 2005a, 120). A series of radiocarbon dates were attained for the middle enclosing element (see Grogan 2005a, Table 6.1) dating the original construction of the bank to 1125_918 BC, with subsequent alterations occurring  between 1000 BC to 800 BC (Grogan 2005a, 186).

Excavations produced coarse ware from the ditch fill and underneath the hillfort bank (Proudfoot 1954; 1955). Proudfoot (1954) suggests that these sherds are similar to the Late Bronze Age pottery from crannogs at Ballinderry 2, Knocknalappa and Lough Gara. Raftery (1969, 93_94) describes the Downpatrick and Freestone Hill pottery assemblages as «superficially comparable and later (Raftery 1976, 351) dated the hillfort to the Late Bronze Age. Intensive occupation of the hilltop in the Early and High Medieval periods saw the refurbishment of the enclosing elements (Proudfoot 1954, 100).            Upon excavation the enclosing elements were shown to comprise a ditch-bank-ditch arrangement, although several phases of construction were noted by Proudfoot (1954, 97_98), potentially ranging from the Late Bronze Age to Medieval periods. Upon excavation, the inner ditch measured 3.3m wide and almost 2.4m deep (Proudfoot 1954, 100). Proudfoot (1955, 66) suggests that the inner ditch is of slightly later date, and that the bank and outer ditch are contemporary. A small counterscarp bank was also noted on the outside of the ditch.           A series of post-holes at the edge of the exterior bank face, suggest a palisade was used to contain an earthen bank (Proudfoot 1954, 98 _ 99). No charcoal was present inferring the palisade had decayed in-situ. Further excavations revealed that a similar setting of post-holes abutting the inner face of the bank was linked to the outer example by a series of shallow transverse trenches which have been interpreted as the bedding trenches for tie-beams (Proudfoot 1955a, 59), although this seems to be a later «re-furbishment of the enclosing elements and not an original feature. Further tie-beams may have been used throughout the height of the bank, but have been destroyed by its erosion (Proudfoot 1955, 59).","Estimated area based on traces visible on satellite imagery and Proudfoot (1954, fig2)",NA,NA,NA,And ditches,NA,Internal and external ditch with intervening bank.,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,Yes

Tentative traces of a palisade trench were found on the N facing crest of the inner bank and possibly along the N face of the next bank while there were also indications of possible stone facing on the N sides of both banks (ibid., 303). The ditches range in depth from 0.98m to 1.55m below the old ground surface and are 5.6m to 12m wide.

Phase 1 is represented by the inner half of the wall; this measures 4.8m in width and 2.76m in height and has 3 terraces along its inner face. At a later stage the exterior capstone of the entrance passage cracked and pillars were inserted along the E side wall to give support. The passage was also extended outwards.","In late January 2014, as a result of serious storm damage, a substantial portion of the fort along the internal western cliff edge fell into the sea, reducing the overall enclosed area to no more than 0.05ha.",NA,NA,"Terraced profile of the wall, though a wall-walk as such may not have survived","Four earthen banks, one stone rampart, under which is the remains of an earlier shallow ditch with burnt timber fence dating to the Late Bronze Age.",NA,NA,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes

The bank comprised a clay core with vertical flagstones supported by a drystone wall. In the early sixth century BC a box-constructed timber rampart employing vertical and horizontal timbers constructed on top of and partially following the alignment of the original bank, and formed from two rows of vertical slabs set in trenches separated by 3m with internal cellular walls filled with clay. The core was topped with flagstones that had stone lined-posts at 3m intervals. Externally there was a berm and flat-bottomed ditch 3m wide 2m deep and an external bank. In the mid-sixth century the enclosure was refortified by two further banks and ditches enclosing the whole summit of the hill (3.7ha) using the same construction method as the univallate fort which itself was further reinforced by additional walling at that time. The earlier bank and ditch was reinforced by a second rampart and postholes provide evidence for timbers for a shelter attached to the rampart. Finally a multivallate phase with C14 dates of 450 +/- 130 bc and 460 +/- 130 bc, enclosing 12ha. The earlier rampart was levelled and widened to cover the berm and half of the ditch and a new wall constructed. A V-shaped ditch and counterscarp surrounded the summit with a third dump rampart in the E and a fourth bank aligned on an entrance in the E.

The outermost defences are those named 'Dñn Kilmore', which comprise a curved ditch 3m wide and 1.2m deep drawn across easternmost neck joining the headland to the mainland of the island. Its rampart is an earthen, externally stone-faced bank c. 6m thick and standing 3m above the bottom of the external ditch and 1.5m high internally. The external facing is composed of slab stonework in level courses with a well-constructed batter, and has been carried back westwards in a gentle curve along the cliff-edge on the N of the neck. On the E it has an entrance 1.8m wide lined with large slabs. Between this and a ringfort that spans the neck immediately to the rear of these defences, kerb of slabs barely rising above the ground was noted by Westropp running NNW and SSE (Westropp 1914, 314).  The second occupies the southern arm of the headland. Its defences comprise three banks with intermediate ditches that cut across the neck of the headland over a distance of 37m. The inner bank is 2m-3.5m wide, nearly levelled but once capped by a stone rampart. The ditch outside it is 4.8m wide and in parts 2.1m deep. The middle bank was 4.8m wide with the foundation of a dry-stone wall on its outer edge, and the ditch between it and the outer bank 3m wide and 1.5m deep; the outer bank was in a bad state of repair when visited by Westropp in 1914, but was 2.4m wide.  The third fortification, occupying the northern arm of the headland is defended at the neck by the remains of a mortared wall. Outside the wall, however, is a bank and a drystone wall with an external ditch  8.5m wide and 2.7m deep; there are also faint traces of an outer wall. Westropp notes that in 1909 a 'mortar-built gatehouse with rude loopholes stood in part to the N side but heavy rains had produced a slide of all the top soil and ruin' (1914, 314). The mortar-built inner wall of the gatehouse measured 3m thick and 1.2m high.","Three seperate areas are enclosed on the headland.

The defences overlain in the S by housing, gardens and other modern features but elsewhere are preserved in woodland. The site is approximately oval in plan measuring 310m NE-SW by 230m transversely. It comprises three banks and two medial ditches in the SE and SW and two banks and a medial ditch on the NE and NW. The inner bank averages 8m wide and between 0.8-1.2m high above the internal ground level, the ditch between 6-12m wide and 2.5-3m deep, with steep sides and a flat base. A second bank, possibly a counterscarp, with a maximum width of 6m and height of 1.0m, runs around most of the northern defences, except at the northernmost point where it has been destroyed by a small quarry. A further line of defences lie outside this bank, extending for approximately 180m in the SW. A second ditch approximately 6m wide and 0.6m deep lies between the two outer banks. In the NW, a section of the external ditch and outer bank beginning in the N, extends in a straight line towards the NW for 90m with the inner defences curving to the NE. Kimballs excavations demonstrated that the outer bank and ditch extended no further N than the extent of the surviving earthworks, and that this terminal was linked to the inner defences by a short section of bank and ditch which pre-dated the ramparts. A trench placed across the defences in the N showed that the old turf line survived beneath both banks, and that the original depth of the ditch was 4m. A survey in 1912 confirmed that the inner bank and ditch, and the second bank once continued across the area now occupied by housing. Traces of the main ditch are still visible to the rear of gardens and recorded during commercial interventions (BCAMS 1992; Lightfoot 2002). A small excavation in 1992 in one of the gardens found no trace of a bank or ditch on the projected line of the outer defences, possibly indicating that the multivallation did not continue in that area.",Areas estimated from OS mapping,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,No,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes
