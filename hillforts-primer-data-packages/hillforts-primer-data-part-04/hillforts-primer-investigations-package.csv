This possible souterrain was later dismissed by O'Kelly as the remains of the Medieval house, mistaken by Westropp as an underground passage (1952, 39). The site was excavated by O'Kelly, where the remains of a Medieval house, curtain wall and stone causeway were revealed. The earlier ditch was shown to be re-cut during this phase of activity.

A previous plan drawn by David Christison in the course of excavations carried out by Richard Bell about 1896 (Christison 1898, 159-62, fig 57; Bell 1895; Bell 1905) is a plainly sketch and lacks the metrical accuracy of the OS map.

It was subsequently described in the 1890s in some detail by the Rev J K Hewison (1893, 289-92), and excavations were carried out by John Marshall and Ludovic Mann in 1914, 1915 and 1919 (Mann 1915; 1925; Marshall 1915). A description was drawn up in 1943 as part of the RCAHMS Emergency Surveys, and copies of photographs taken in 1958 by Helen Nisbet as part of her research into vitrified forts are held in RCAHMS (see Nisbet 1975). The fort seems to have been visited by Kenneth Steer about 1975, and the following year, 1976, by the OS. Two seasons of survey work were carried out in 1994-5 (Harding, Ralston and Burgess 1995; Harding 1997, 121; 2004a, 141-4; 2004b), suggesting that there was also a much larger fortification here taking in the adjacent ridge of outcrop to the NE, an interpretation that is not shared by RCAHMS investigators, who in 2009-10, in the course of a new survey, suggested that the evidence for this outer enclosure related to a much later agricultural landscape (Geddes and Hale 2010, 22-5).

The first written survey of the fort is to be found in the writings of the Cork antiquary, John Windele, who visited it in 1848. Windele reported that the stone rampart 'extends in a straight line 'and that in his day the entrance-way was in its centre with the two' creeps' on either side. In 1856 George Du Noyer visited the site and two years later he published a report on it which included a plan of the fort showing, again, that the rampart wall cut off the end of the promontory in a straight line with chambers on either side of the entrance-way. In 1892, the fort was acquired by the Commissioners of Public Works from a Mr Charles Drummond as a National Monument (No. 177). As a result of this, a programme of reconstruction work was undertaken. As well as all the reconstruction work, the dry-stone walls of three leaseholders' fields that crossed the fort in a north south direction were also removed. A boundary wall, gate and stile were constructed around the perimeter of the fort to protect it and to mark out the area of the National Monument. From June to September 1977 the site was partially excavated by Terry Barry. The areas chosen for investigation included cutting sections through the landward earthen defences, and almost the entirety of the main stone rampart and the cloch_n (Barry 1981).

It was visited in 1952 during the survey of the route of the Roman Road (Radford et al 1953, 33), when it was described as 'a small fort of the sub-Roman or early medieval period', one of the authors subsequently speculating that the occupants of the Roberton Motte probably moved here to establish a manor, the main evidence simply being the site of a medieval chapel here and the presence of a mill (Reid 1957, 141-2). While there is no disputing the proximity of the church and village, there is no immutable evidence that these are castle earthworks, and the topographical characteristics of the site are such that it is as likely to have been fortified in earlier periods.

This is probably the 'Roman Camp' referred to in the Statistical Accounts (Stat Acct 18, 1796, 179; NSA 6, Lanarkshire, 554). David Christison visited the site in 1889 (Christison 1890, 291). Evidently the depiction bears no correspondence to the cropmarks that have been recorded, and while the OS surveyor in 1968, following up a previous visit in 1955, suggested that this discrepancy might indicate that there are two separate monuments here, the one a prehistoric fort and the other a larger enclosure, such a hypothesis must await further work. The site was visited in 1971 by RCAHMS investigators during the preparation of the County Inventory for Lanarkshire (RCAHMS 1978, 102, no.232).",1st Identified Written Reference (1796); 1st Identified Map Depiction (1858); Other (1889); Other (1955); Other (1968); Other (1971)

Excavation and survey work in 1993-95 to accompany a programme of erosion repairs; excavation of one of the two summit barrows showed that its lower portion survived intact beneath stone capping.

The survey and field report will feature in the forthcoming publication of the prehistoric and Roman material from the 1966-70 & 1973 excavations.

A hiatus ensued prior to the construction of a ?Beaker rectilinear ditched enclosure, followed by intensive Iron Age occupation with circular buildings and a trackway. The site lies just below the south-west gate of Cadbury Castle. Those involved in the investigation included students from Bristol University Dept. Archaeology.

The grass-grown portion of this headland beyond the arch extends for about 320m (2.2ha), and runs out a further 350m as a spit of bare rock.
