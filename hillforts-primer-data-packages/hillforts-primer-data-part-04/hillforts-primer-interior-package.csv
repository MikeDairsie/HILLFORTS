Cleary (2012, 9) notes that there is a minimum of 340 vessels from these excavations, the bulk of which came from layers that seem to have been deposited mainly in the period 1000 _ 800 cal. BC. Other likely Late Bronze Age finds included 460 fragments of clay crucible moulds. Eight types of instruments or weapons were definitively identified from moulds, including 1 sword, 2 spearheads, 3 socketed axe-heads, 2 knives, 2 ball pinheads, 4 disc heads or decorated studs/buttons, 4 pin shanks and 2 rings/bracelets (OCarroll 2012a). Further evidence for the casting of these items is apparent in the 28 sherds of crucibles of varying size and form. Traces of copper-alloy identified on the outer surface of one complete example attests to their use (OCarroll 2012b).  A large corpus of finds was recovered, mainly from the inner enclosure, including 40 bronze objects, the most famous of which are the four Bronze rings (Cotter 2012b, 48 _ 49). 17 pieces of amber, the majority in the form of beads (Feeney-Johnson 2012, 93) attest to potential continental trade networks. Analysis of these confirm that, with the exception of one example, all amber finds were made from Baltic succinate (Feeney-Johnson 2012, 96). 14 Iron Age/Early Medieval blue glass beads attest to later occupation of the hillfort (Fitzgerald and Warner 2012). Numerous stone, bone and iron implements were also recovered from the site.         The fish bone assemblage from D–n Aonghasa constitutes the largest collection of Bronze Age fish bone in Ireland (McCarthy 2012, 172). These bones, in combination with large quantities of recovered shells, indicate exploitation of nearby marine resources. The identification of eleven different species of fish reflects the variety available in the vicinity of the site (McCarthy 2012, 173). This unique availability of faunal resources at the Aran Islands is partly the result of the islands being at the meeting of northern and southern temperate waters, where species from both bodies meet and mix (OConnell and Roden 1994, 47).

2963,"Tillymuick, Aberdeenshire","While the 1st edition OS 25-inch map (Aberdeenshire 1870, shhet 44.15) shows one ring-bank and two tumuli, in 1943 Angus Graham reported 'perhaps up to two dozen' features that he considered to be the remains of hut-circles, some of which were platformed into the slope, and three small cairns. On a subsequent visit after heather burning he recognised many more, and the plan drawn up by Richard Feachem in 1957, when only the W third was obscured by deep heather, shows no less than 56, and a single rectangle, though he was circumspect in his description of their precise character and found it hard to believe that the sparse circles were the footings of walls.
